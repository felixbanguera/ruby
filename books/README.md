This folder will store the books found in the web for Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

Again, this books are found in the web so I take no credit of them, just use them to study and provide them for other people to study too.

Feel free to make contributions to this Folder by creating pull requests. Regards.

The following is the list which I hope will be updated every time a book is added.
